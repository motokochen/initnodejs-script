This is a very simple script for starting up a web site with Nodejs.
You can easily to use it by the command as following:
 # sh initnode.sh <projectname>

It will create a folder named <projectname> (you can name your project yourself.)
And go to the project folder and use the command as following:
 # node mainjs.js

You will see the web site is up on port 3000 and you can test it in your local device.
Typing 'localhost:3000' in your local bowser, and you will see 'Hello World'.

Finally, enjoy it.
